# Responsive HTML Web Page Template

Responsive Web Design is a set expectation for web sites today. Often you will gather bits and pieces of responsive templates from popular [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Zhurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) or the like and then integrate this with other popular JS libraries such as [JQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) to get your basic page layout.

Quite often, you will end up mis-interpreting, or mistakenly copy-n-pasting a thing or two later through examples, or else over the web. Sometimes borrowing mistakenly implemented code snippets could also prove detrimental to your work on responsive page layouts.

Or you will use this ready made responsive skeleton template ready with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), [JQuery](http://jquery.com/), and [Respond JS](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond).
